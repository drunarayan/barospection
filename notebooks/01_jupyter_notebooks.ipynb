    "In this project you will get beginner's introduction to using JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks. For this course we created a JupyterHub virtual environment on Google Cloud where you will login to access course materials. These include inital version of Jupyter Notebooks, images, video, CSV files and other media which you will modify to create your own versions and publish them.\n",

    "\n",
    "**JupyterLab** is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. It enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. It is the interface that you're looking at right now.  If you like a tour, you can click [Getting started with JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html).  Instead, you can also jump straight in below and learn by doing it!  If you are confused, come back to the above link.\n",

They are a document that blends computations, outputs, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.  Notebooks contains multiple cells containing either Markdown syntax for text and images or Python code.\n"
